# s AI Engineering Hub: The Token Cooperative

## 1. Executive Vision & Strategy
We are organizing a decentralized engineering effort—the "Token Cooperative"—to utilize pooled organizational AI credits (GitHub Copilot, Azure AI) to build high-value architectural tooling. 

**The Core Principle: AI-First Execution**
We do not use AI simply to write code; we instruct the AI to execute the code, run the tests, and iterate. The AI acts as the primary operator, steered by the engineer via the IDE.

**The Strategy: Token Utilization as a Performance Metric**
By pooling resources to run high-compute architectural tasks, participating colleagues can effectively utilize their allocated token thresholds to generate systemic tools for the broader team, boosting their internal adoption metrics while solving shared engineering bottlenecks. 

**Phased Execution:**
1. **Analysis & Planning:** Run at absolute maximum settings (1M+ context, highest reasoning) to map complex architectures and generate baseline documentation.
2. **Implementation:** Scale settings down to optimize the token burn rate once the architectural plan is established.

## 2. Document-Driven AI Architecture
All AI initiatives must be heavily documented upfront to prevent context hallucination and ensure strict adherence to TD's architectural standards.

Before generating any code or scripts, the AI must output the following structure:
1. **Current State Analysis:** Map the existing dependencies, bottlenecks, or logic flaws.
2. **The Plan:** Propose a high-level architectural strategy that includes risk mitigation.
3. **The To-Do List:** Break the plan down into sequential, actionable engineering tasks.
*Implementation code is strictly prohibited until the To-Do list is human-reviewed and approved.*

## 3. Collaborative Intake & Pain Point Mapping
The Token Cooperative is a shared platform, not a top-down mandate. 
* **1-on-1 Outreach:** Engage colleagues individually to identify their specific engineering bottlenecks (CI/CD friction, testing delays, legacy code navigation).
* **Collaborative Ideation:** Actively study new use cases together. If a colleague identifies a recurring problem, we leverage the AI-First framework and the shared token pool to build a bespoke solution.

## 4. The Active AI Engineering Backlog

### Initiative A: CIBDM Cross-App Analysis (The Mega-Repo)
* **Objective:** Ingest the four distinct CIBDM applications and their infrastructure into a single `CIBDM_Master` folder to analyze cross-application dependencies.
* **Methodology:** Use a massive context window to parse the entire ecosystem simultaneously (no vector databases or RAG workarounds for the initial pass).
* **Deliverable:** Extract common code, document shared patterns, and ensure cross-app understanding to bridge the lack of agent-to-agent handover.

### Initiative B: TDSAP & Repo-Level Tooling (Azure AI Pathfinder)
* **Objective:** Establish the organization's standard patterns for Azure AI integration, using TDSAP as the pathfinder project.
* **Methodology:** Build embedded AI skills and agents directly into the TDSAP repository.
* **Deliverable:** Automated workflows and strict IDE guardrails tailored for enterprise architects who require safe, compliant scaffolding to contribute code.

### Initiative C: Synthetic Relational Data Builder
* **Objective:** Unblock local performance testing by generating complex, production-scale relational data.
* **Methodology:** Use AI to analyze production database schemas to map complex table relationships and joint probability distributions without exposing PII.
* **Deliverable:** A high-performance generator script that builds 500,000+ rows of anonymized test data while strictly preserving referential integrity.

### Initiative D: ServiceNow Deployment Ticket Automation
* **Objective:** Reduce deployment friction and PR-to-deployment cycle times.
* **Methodology:** Analyze historical ServiceNow tickets alongside the related Microsoft Teams deployment chats to understand the unwritten rules of the Change Advisory Board (CAB).
* **Deliverable:** A dynamic rulebook and scraper to auto-populate compliant tickets.

### Initiative E: Guided Application Scanning
* **Objective:** End-to-end security and performance scanning across all cooperative repositories.
* **Deliverable:** Deep vulnerability assessments and architectural bottleneck reports.
